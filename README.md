# MechaCar_StatisticalAnalysis

## Technical Analysis MechaCar dataset
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	- The Vehicle_weight and Spoiler_angle variables provided a non-random amount of variance.
	
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?
	- No the slope of a linear model is not considered to be zero.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
	- Yes, this linear model predicts mpg of all MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Technical Analysis Suspension Coil dataset
### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually?
	- No, the current manufacturing data does not meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots. Lot 3 has a variance almost 70 points above the design specifications as showen in the image below.

## T-Tests Analysis on Suspension Coils
### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- From the following t-test results we can conclude that the p-value for all three Lots is above 0.05, hence the null hypothesis is true and the lots are statistically similar from the mean population.
